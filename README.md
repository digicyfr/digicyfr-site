This repository demonstrates how to bootstrap a React project using Vite.

## Install Node.js

Install Node.js from the [official downloads page](https://nodejs.org/) or via your preferred package manager.

## Create a Vite React project

Run the following command and follow the prompts:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react
```

This generates a new React project inside `my-app`.

## Run the development server

Inside the `my-app` directory, install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

A local server will start, and you can see your app in the browser.

## Build for production

To create an optimized production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This outputs files ready to deploy in the `dist` directory.

## Copy into this repository

If you created the project elsewhere, copy or move its files into this repository to track them in version control.
